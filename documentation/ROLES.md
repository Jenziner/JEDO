**Roles within the JEDO ecosystem**
===============================

The JEDO ecosystem is divided into several hierarchical layers, each assuming specific roles and thus TCR (Tasks, Competencies, and Responsibilities). This structure supports the decentralization and scalability of the blockchain infrastructure. Layer is written in capital letters, followd by the role name.

# ORBIS - Operator
## Description
ORBIS is the highest organizational hierarchical layer. It encompasses minimal TCR to technically guarantee the decentralized setup. A failure of ORBIS should not lead to a halt in the JEDO ecosystem. The following ORBIS are defined:
- jedo.me - productive ORBIS
- jedo.cc - ORBIS to demonstrate the JEDO ecosystem to interested parties (demo environment)
- jedo.dev - ORBIS for developers to make changes to the code (development environments)

## Tasks
- Operate Root-CA servers (offline and tamper-proof).

## Competencies
- Merge pull requests (in the GitHub repository of the JEDO ecosystem).
- Enroll REGNUM certificates.

## Responsibilities
- Ensure the validity of REGNUM certificates.

## Active Members

# REGNUM - Contributor
## Description
REGNUM is the geographical division of ORBIS aimed at promoting decentralization and supporting performance. Each REGNUM operates its own blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric Channel) and is compatible with other REGNUMs. The following REGNUMs are defined:
- EA (Eurasia)
- AS (Asia)
- AF (Africa)
- NA (North America)
- SA (South America)

## Tasks
- Operate CA servers.
- Implement requirements.

## Competencies
- Register and enroll AGER certificates.
- Commit implementations and create pull requests.

## Responsibilities
- Ensure the validity of AGER certificates.

## Active Members

# AGER - Issuer
## Description
An AGER is an economically cohesive region with comparable performance values in FIAT (according to the Big Mac Index). Examples of AGER within EA:
- ALPS
- JURA
- MEDITERRANEAN

## Tasks
- Operate CA servers, Peer servers and Orderer servers.

## Competencies
- Register and enroll GENS certificates.

## Responsibilities
- Ensure the validity of GENS certificates.


# GENS - Owner
## Description
A GENS is the smallest organizational unit managing individual users (HUMAN). This unit can be an ideological or geographical association and does not pursue an economic purpose.

## Tasks
- Operate Peer servers and Orderer servers (if requested).

## Competencies
- Register and enroll HUMAN certificates.

## Responsibilities
- Ensure the uniqueness, authenticity, and reliability of HUMANs.


# HUMAN - User
## Description
A HUMAN is the person and end-user of the JEDO ecosystem. They interact with the JEDO ecosystem for the purpose of exchanging values (JEDO) and participating in the development process of the JEDO ecosystem.

## Tasks
- Interact with the JEDO ecosystem in good faith.

## Competencies
- Submit requirements for the further development of the JEDO ecosystem.
- Vote on requirements in the JEDO ecosystem.

## Responsibilities
- Adhere to the principles of the JEDO MANIFEST.
