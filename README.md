# JEDO - Home of the JEDO ecosystem.
The JEDO ecosystem aims to create a more stable, fair, and sustainable economic future. It emphasizes decentralization, financial inclusion, and technological innovations like blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and autonomy. It address various economic, social, and technological challenges.
The JEDO ecosystem introduces a digital currency called JEDO, which is used for everyday transactions. The system is designed to limit speculation by capping the amount of JEDO one can hold, thereby focusing on daily necessities rather than investment. The value of JEDO is tied to the BigMac Index, ensuring that its value remains stable and comparable across different regions.
Moreover, the system promotes social justice by ensuring equal access to financial resources, regardless of one's location or identity. It is built on blockchain technology, which ensures security and decentralization through consensus mechanisms like Proof of Reconciliation (PoR) and Proof of Authority (PoA). The system is also designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments based on democratic processes involving its participants.
